# Star Wars Project

## Installing

You'll need to have node and npm installed on your system.

For local development and testing, clone the repo to your local machine.

From the root of the repo, install your dependencies:

```npm install```

## Running the Project

To get started, run the following:

```npm run dev```

This should take care of all the bundling and should kick off a local instance of the application.
